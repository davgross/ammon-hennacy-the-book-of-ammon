				<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
                                <h3>Book Reviews</h3>
				<h3>1950⁠–⁠1960</h3>
			</header>
			<p>Inasmuch as I have gained insight from others, a short summary of the most important book reviews I have written for the <i epub:type="se:name:publication:magazine"><abbr class="initialism">CW</abbr></i> and in the <abbr class="initialism">I.W.W.</abbr> paper <i epub:type="se:name:publication:newspaper">Industrial Worker</i> is given.
			<section epub:type="subchapter">
				<p><i epub:type="se:name:publication:book">The Hopi Way</i> by Laura Thompson, and <i epub:type="se:name:publication:book">Culture in Crisis, a study of the Hopi Indians</i>, former <abbr class="initialism">U.</abbr> of Chicago Press, and latter by Harpers. The thesis of <i epub:type="se:name:publication:book">Culture in Crisis</i> is that the influence of missionaries, especially Mennonite, has broken down traditional religious beliefs of the Hopi in the villages of New Oraibi, Upper Moencopi, and Bacobi. And also that the coercive measures of the government have produced “rigidity and ultra-conservatism” in the outstanding rebel village of Hotevilla and in a lesser extent in Shongopovi. As the white man’s world crumbles, the Hopi are shown to have a world outlook, a faith, a Way of Life more satisfying and wholesome than that of the ancient Greek city-states or of any modern Utopia. Will the Indian Bureau succeed in demoralizing the Hopi? Will the missionaries, the army, and the cattle and oil men succeed in getting the souls and bodies of the Hopi? The author says that &ldquo;The Navajo-Hopi land dispute was not legally settled until 1943, when the Navajo were confirmed in the use of three-quarters of the original Hopi reservation which they had upsurged and were occupying, leaving the Hopi the use of only 986 square miles of desert land.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><i epub:type="se:name:publication:book">The Autobiography of Mother Jones</i>, Mary Field Parton, Charles <abbr class="name">H.</abbr> Kerr <abbr>Co.</abbr>, Chicago, 1925. Reviewed in <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 21, 1951 <i epub:type="se:name:publication:magazine">Industrial Worker</i>.</p>
				<p>“There’s only one thing to be afraid of … not being a man.” This was the characteristic brave answer of Mother Jones in 1919, at the age of 89, during the steel strike when a union official felt it might compromise their fight to allow a Communist to put out leaflets in the union hall lauding Russian revolt. She was born in County Cork of a family of fighters against British terrorism, she taught in a parochial school in Monroe, <abbr class="postal">Mich.</abbr>, had a dressmaking shop for the rich until burned out by the Chicago Fire of 1871. She then became an organizer for the United Mine Workers until her death at the age of 100. She led hundreds of the wives of miners, armed with mops and brooms and banging on dishpans, to the mine pits, straight up to the machine guns of the Colorado thugs. On elections she said, “You don’t need to vote to raise hell … you need convictions and a voice.”</p>

				<p><i epub:type="se:name:publication:book">The Life of Mahatma Gandhi</i> by Louis Fischer. Harpers, <abbr class="postal">N.Y.</abbr>, 1950. $5.00</p>

				<p>In dealing with the enemy it was Good will to the enemy that Gandhi always had. Fischer said that “Victory came [in South Africa] to Gandhi not when Smuts had no more strength to fight him but when he had no more heart to fight him.&rdquo; Gandhi’s idea of fasting is little-understood in the West. Fischer quotes him as saying: “One may fast against those who love you, not against a tyrant.” Gandhi said, “We must widen the prison gates … Freedom is to be wooed only inside prison walls and sometimes on gallows, never in the council chambers, courts, or the schoolroom.” Fischer contrasts Churchill and Gandhi: &ldquo;Churchill is the Byronic Napoleon. Political power is poetry to him. Gandhi was the sober saint to whom such power was anathema. The British aristocrat and the brown plebian were both conservative, but Gandhi was a nonconformist conservative. As he grew older Churchill became more Tory, Gandhi more revolutionary. Churchill loved social traditions. Gandhi smashed social barriers. Churchill mixed with every class, but lived in own. Gandhi lived with everybody. To Gandhi, the lowliest Indian was a child of God. To Churchill, all Indians were the pedestal for a throne. He would have died to keep England free, but tried to destroy those who wanted India free.&rdquo;</p>
