			<p>This ebook is based on a physical copy of the fifth printing of the book, and on digital scan and partial transcription of an earlier Hennacy autobiography produced for <a href="https://archive.org/details/AutobiographyOfACatholicAnarchist">Archive.org</a>, and on its transcription found at <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_a_Catholic_Anarchist">Wikisource</a>.</p>
			<p>The book was published in 1970 without a copyright notice, and so it is in the public domain. This accords with the anarchist principles of the author, who would not have asked the government to help him defend a copyright in his writings.</p>
			<p>The author wishes to express thanks for the use of quotations from Karl Jung, and from the poets Robert Frost, Lillian Spencer, and Vachel Lindsay.</p>
			<p>The writing and artwork within are believed to be in the <abbr class="initialism">U.S.</abbr> public domain, and is released under the terms in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a>.
